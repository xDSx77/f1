The Formula-One project, Epita, 30/10/18 - 09/11/18

A project which consist in finding the finish line of a map without knowing where it is and 
moving the car from the beginning to this line. There are different types of block on the map: 
grass, road, water, wall. We must find the way which is the less costly (A* or Dijkstra algortihm
for example) between these two points. Of course, the car has to go to the finish line as quickly 
as possible.

Explanations of the different functions present in the source files:
