The Formula-One project, Epita, 30/10/18 - 09/11/18

A project which consist in finding the finish line of a map without knowing
where it is and moving the car from the beginning to this line.
There are different types of block on the map: grass, road, water, wall.
We must find the way which is the less costly (A* or Dijkstra algortihm for
example) between these two points. Of course, the car has to go to the
finish line as quickly as possible.

Explanations of the different functions present in the source files:

fifo.c:

- fifo_init : generate the fifo (first in, first out) which will be necessary
  to create the graph and to contain its nodes.
- fifo_enqueue : add a node in the fifo.
- fifo_dequeue : remove a node from the fifo.
- fifo_empty : test if the fifo is empty (return 0 if empty or the size of the
  fifo if it's not empty)

parse_map.c:

- map_get_finish_x : find the absciss of the finish line
- map_get_finish_y : find the ordinate of the finish line
